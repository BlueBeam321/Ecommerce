Developers
==========

Before starting to enhance libdvbpsi as you downloaded it from the git repository
at git.videolan.org make sure you have autotools (autoconf, automake, m4, libtool)
installed.

Clone the repository:

  git clone git://git.videolan.org/libdvbpsi.git

In contrast to other autotools enabled programs libdvbpsi uses a script named
'bootstrap' to generate the configure script. Others use a program 'autogen.sh'
for that. For libdvbpsi you need to run:

  ./bootstrap

Run the configure script for development:

  ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-debug --disable-release

Now you can start enhancing libdvbpsi.

Configuring "libdvbpsi"
=======================

A typical way to configure libdvbpsi is:

  ./configure --prefix=/usr

See './configure --help' for more information.

If you intend to debug stuff, you may want to compile with debugging
symbols:

  ./configure --enable-debug

If you want a fully optimized version you should use

  ./configure --enable-release


Building "libdvbpsi"
====================

Once configured, run 'make' to build the library and the programs
located in the 'examples' and 'misc' directories.

Installing and using "libdvbpsi"
================================

You can install the library, its headers and the programs located in
the 'examples' directory by typing:

  make install

Including one of the headers is done by adding the following line in
your '.c' file:

  #include <dvbpsi/dvbpsi.h>

The program must be linked against the lib with the '-ldvbpsi' option
for gcc.

Building documentation
======================

Once configured, run 'make doc' to build the documentation in html
(doc/doxygen/html) and latex (doc/doxygen/latex). You'll need the
doxygen tool (http://www.doxygen.org/) and the graphviz tool
(http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz).

Building packages
=================

Once configure, run 'make dist', this will generate a libdvbpsi-${VERSION}.tar.gz
and libdvbpsi-${VERSION}.tar.bz2. If you intend to build a package for RPM based
linux distributions, then you can run 'rpmbuild -ta libdvbpsi-${VERSION}.tar.gz'
or 'rpmbuild -ta libdvbpsi-${VERSION}.tar.bz2'.

For distributions that use another package management system look at their documentation
on howto create a installable package for it.
